# Breakout:

A Timesheet application which will be used by employees to clock-in, clock-out and see a list of all their time entries when they arrive at work and leave.

# Please describe your process for approaching the code challenge. What kind of planning did you do? Did your plans change as you began coding?

At first, I make a plan to use React framework, class-based component, useState for state management, bootstrap for styling, easytimer.js for the timer and Mongo dB for database.
As I began coding, I changed some of the above, like I used styled-components for a better experience with the components, I used functions instead of classes in some components. For state management later on I used redux which was my first time using redux. I also used firebase for hosting and Google authentication.

# (I used two things at the same time because of giving a variety of approach and for my practice)

# If you were given another day to work on this, how would you spend it? What if you were given a month?

If I had another day I would like to save the time entries data for each user, and if had a month I would like to make it a fully functional app With a lot of similar features.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
